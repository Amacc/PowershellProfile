# PowershellProfile

My personal powershell profile.

This is to record how I keep my powershell environment.

## Directories

- Config: Configuration files for the environment, anytime i need to
    call a function to set config it goes here.
    
- Variables: Variables to seed into the environment, things like environment
    variables and quick access tokens goes here.

- Functions: Small functions go here till they find a home in a module.
